    <h3>A pastel (pl. pastéis) is a typical Brazilian fast-food dish, consisting of half-circle or rectangle-shaped thin crust pies with assorted fillings, fried in vegetable oil. The result is a crispy, brownish fried pie. The most common fillings are ground meat, mozzarella, catupiry, heart of palm, codfish, cream cheese, chicken and small shrimp.</h3><br>
    <h1><ion-text color="tertiary">History of Pastel</ion-text></h1><br>
    <h3>It is popularly said to have originated when Japanese immigrants adapted Chinese fried wontons to sell as snacks at weekly street markets.<br><br>
      This is the most likely hypothesis as even today many of the "pastelarias" are owned or run by Chinese and Japanese immigrants. Italian Brazilians have said the Brazilian dishes pastel and fogazza originated from fried calzones.<br><br>
      It is possible, however, that pastel originated from Indian samosas when the dish became part of the Portuguese cuisine. A common beverage to drink with pastéis is sugarcane juice.<br><br>

        <h1><ion-text color="tertiary">Ingredients</ion-text></h1><br>
        <h2>PASTEL DOUGH</h2><br><br>
        <h3>3 cups all purpose flour, plus more for dusting<br><br>
          1 tablespoon salt, or to taste<br><br>
          1 cup warm water<br><br>
          1 tablespoon vegetable oil><br><br>
          1 tablespoon white wine vinegar<br><br>
          1 tablespoon cachaça<br><br>
          Vegetable oil for frying<br><br>
        </h3>
          <h2>GROUND BEEF FILLING:</h2><br><br>
          <h3>2 tablespoons olive oil<br><br>
            1 small onion, finely chopped<br><br>
            2 cloves of garlic, finely minced<br><br>
            1/2 pound ground beef<br><br>
            Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste<br><br>
            1/3 cup olives, sliced<br><br>
            1/3 cup chopped parsley<br><br>
          </h3>
        <h1><ion-text color="tertiary">Instructions</ion-text></h1><br>
        <h2>MAKING THE DOUGH</h2><br><br>
        <h3>1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a hole in the middle and add the water, oil, vinegar and cachaça. Mix well, using your hands, then transfer to a 
          flour dusted surface and knead until the dough is smooth, elastic and no longer sticking to your hands or counter. Cover with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br><br>
          </h3>
          <h2>GROUND BEEF FILLING</h2><br><br>
          <h3>1. In a large skillet, over medium high heat, add the olive oil and then sauté the onion and garlic until translucent, about 2 minutes.<br><br>
              2. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it into a few large pieces with a wooden spoon. Let the meat brown without moving it for a few minutes.<br><br>
              3. Break the beef into smaller pieces and continue browning. Do not stir continuously, so the moisture can evaporate and allow the meat to brown. The meat 
              might release some water. Just continue cooking until all the water has evaporated, as excess moisture might make the pastéis soggy.<br><br>
              4. Once the beef is evenly browned, season with salt and pepper. Add the olives and parsley, then remove from heat. Reserve.<br><br>
          </h3>
          <h2>ASSEMBLING THE PASTÉIS</h2><br><br>
          <h3>1. Divide the dough in half. On a floured surface, roll out one of the halves as thinly as you can (about a 9 by 12-inch rectangle), without tearing the dough. 
            Using a round cookie cutter (I use a 4-inch), cut about 15 circles of dough and reserve on a baking sheet, over parchment paper. You can also cut them into rectangles, 
            as small or big as you'd like.<br><br>
              2. Place a couple of tablespoons (or cubes/slices of cheese) of the desired filling on each circle and then fold into a semi circle, pressing the edges shut. Using a 
              fork, pinch them together all the way around.<br><br>
              3. Roll out the reserved dough and repeat the steps above.<br><br>
              4. Heat a deep saucepan with enough oil to cover the pastéis to about 350F (hot but not smoking). Cook the pastéis in batches until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 
              about 2 minutes.<br><br>
              5. Transfer to paper towels and serve immediately!<br><br>
